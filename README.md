```
Monkey see monkey do
I don't know why
I'd rather be dead than cool
I don't know why
every line ends in rhyme
I don't know why
Less is more love is blind
I don't know why
Stay Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Give an inch take a smile
I don't know why
fashion shits fashion style
I don't know why
throw it out and keep it in
I don't know why
have to have poison skin
I don't know why
Stay Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
<♪>
I don't why
Stay Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Monkey see monkey do
I don't know why
I'd rather be dead than cool
I don't know why
every line ends in rhyme
I don't know why
Less is more love is blind
I don't know why
Stay Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
I don't know why
I don't know why
Stay Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
<♪>
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
God is gay
